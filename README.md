# Volleyball Management System
Extremely hacky, but useful volleyball management system. This software will not win an award for looking good inside and (especially) outside, 
but it provides a basic set of tools to analyze the volleyball gameplay of a team or a player.

## Position management
* Create rotations
* Create actors
* Manage position of actors in each rotation
* Free draw for each rotation
* Export/Import configurations

## Statistics
* Parallel gameplay data collection possible
* View target of each action in a graph
* View data summary for each action
* Dynamically filter data by source player, target player and labels
* Share the data

## TODO
* Seitenaufrufe tracken
* Storage einmal resetten
* Show returned in graphs
* Statistiken bauen
* Delete for statistics
* Target filter player
* Tempo in Graph for toss darstellen?
* Graphs for kill/soft block
